FAQ
================

**Q: How do I pin apps or select specific apps to appear in Hangar?**  
In Hangar go to Settings => Apps, select an app and "Pin app" from the menu.

**Q: How do I customize the icons Hangar displays?**  
You can apply an icon pack by selecting "Icon pack" in Settings => Appearance.  You can also manually adjust each app's icon in Settings => Apps by selecting an app and choosing "Change icon".

**Q: How do I remove the statusbar icon?**  
You can change the position in the Settings => Behavior screen. If you select the bottom position, the icon goes away!  One limitation of Android is that on-going notifications require a notification icon in order to have TOP_PRIORITY as a notification.  As a workaround, I've added a number of icon choices (Settings => Appearance) which includes a Transparent icon.  That icon creates a transparent gap, of course, but it's the best you can do without lowering the priority.

**Q: I can't install Hangar in my country!**  
This is caused by Google limiting in-app purchase apps (which Hangar uses for donations) to exclude certain countries.  However, since Hangar is open source, you can always install it via F-Droid.  F-Droid is an open source app store that will automatically notify you and let you automatically install new versions when they come out. Go grab F-droid here: https://f-droid.org

**Q: Will Hangar drain my battery?**  
No!  It uses very little memory and very little CPU.  It also only runs while your phone is awake and does not hold wakelock.

**Q: Can I have the recency weight and in-app use stats last a week/month/6mos/etc?**  
Sorry again.  Right now time is added forever.  This is one of the highest priority features and will be coming in the near future.
